## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: stdio MCP server with four tools

The system SHALL run a stdio MCP server exposing `search`, `list_sessions`,
`activity_summary`, and `read_session` tools. When `activity_summary` groups by day, it
SHALL bucket by the local calendar day. The system SHALL validate tool inputs at the
request boundary and return a clear tool error for an unsupported value rather than a
generic downstream failure.

#### Scenario: Search tool call

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `search` with a query
- **THEN** the system SHALL return ranked results with snippets, respecting the requested
  limit

#### Scenario: Read session with pagination

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `read_session` for a long session
- **THEN** the system SHALL return a page of messages (default excluding tool output) and
  a `has_more` flag

#### Scenario: Activity summary groups by local day

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `activity_summary` with `group_by: "day"`
- **THEN** the system SHALL bucket each session by its local calendar day (not the UTC
  day)

#### Scenario: Unsupported group_by is rejected at the boundary

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `activity_summary` with a `group_by` other than `day` or
  `project`
- **THEN** the system SHALL return a tool error naming the allowed values, without running
  the query
