## 1. LIKE escaping helper (TDD)

- [x] 1.1 Failing test in `internal/db/db_test.go` for `EscapeLike`: `EscapeLike("a%_\\b")` == `a\%\_\\b`; plain text unchanged.
- [x] 1.2 Implement `db.EscapeLike`; green.

## 2. Literal-safe MATCH builder (TDD)

- [x] 2.1 Failing test in `internal/search/query_test.go` for `buildMatchQuery`:
  `["c++","foo"]` → `"c++" "foo"`; a term containing `"` is doubled; empty slice → "".
- [x] 2.2 Implement `buildMatchQuery`; green.

## 3. Hybrid planner + escaping (TDD, integration)

- [x] 3.1 Failing tests in `internal/search/search_test.go` (on-disk DB via existing
  helpers): seed messages; assert:
  - query `c++` (and `"unclosed`, `foo OR`, `(test`) returns WITHOUT error (no fts5
    syntax error) and matches literal content.
  - mixed-length `auth ui` matches a message containing both "auth" and "ui" and does
    NOT error; a message with only "auth" is excluded.
  - a `--project` prefix containing `_` (e.g. `/x/a_b`) matches only that project, not
    `/x/axb`; a content term containing `%`/`_` matches literally (escaping works).
  - an all-punctuation query (e.g. `***`) and an empty query are handled (empty still
    errors; all-punctuation returns without error).
  - a quoted phrase mixed with a short bare term (e.g. `"auth flow" ui`) works.
  - high-cardinality `auth ui` returns rows that contain BOTH terms (guards against an
    accidental early-LIMIT that would drop short-term matches).
- [x] 3.2 Implement: `buildMatchQuery`-based FTS over the long terms + per-short-term
  `AND m.content LIKE ? ESCAPE '\'` in one query (LIMIT after the LIKE); all-short →
  escaped `likeQuery`; remove `needsLikeFallback`; escape content + project LIKE via
  `db.EscapeLike`. No silent FTS→LIKE fallback (operational FTS errors surface). Green.
- [x] 3.3 Add a test that `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for the hybrid query uses the FTS
  virtual table (FTS-first), confirming no full `messages` scan.

## 4. sessions.ListSessions project escaping + index

- [x] 4.1 Escape the `project_path LIKE` in `internal/sessions/sessions.go` `ListSessions`
  with `db.EscapeLike` + `ESCAPE '\'`; add/adjust a test asserting `_`/`%` don't over-match.
- [x] 4.2 Add `internal/db/migrations/0004_search_indexes.sql` (`idx_sessions_ended`
  only); confirm migrations still apply (db tests green).

## 5. Verify

- [x] 5.1 `go test ./internal/search/ ./internal/sessions/ ./internal/db/ -race -count=1` green.
- [x] 5.2 `go test ./... -count=1`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`,
  `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build ./...` clean; `gofmt -l .` empty.
- [x] 5.3 Self-review, then codex re-review of the diff; address findings.
  (codex High: zero-term query, e.g. `"`, bypassed the empty-query guard and built
  malformed SQL. Fixed: `Search` returns an empty set when the query parses to zero
  terms; added `TestSearchZeroTermQuery` + spec scenario.)
